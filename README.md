World Population Analysis
üåç Project Overview
This project explores patterns and trends in global population data through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The goal is to uncover insights about population growth, regional differences, and demographic patterns using visualization and statistical techniques.

*This project is currently a work-in-progress (WIP).*

üéØ Project Objectives
This project aims to answer the following analytical questions:

Which countries have the highest and lowest populations?

How is the world population distributed across different regions?

What is the relationship between a country's population and its land area?

Are there outliers ‚Äî countries with unusually high or low population relative to their size?

Which countries or regions are experiencing the fastest population growth or decline?

How does population density vary across different parts of the world?

Is there a correlation between population size and geographic, economic, or social indicators (if available)?

What are the visual patterns when comparing population to other factors like GDP, area, or continent? (optional if you add more data)
